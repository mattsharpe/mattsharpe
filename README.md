* A user should be able to fill in all the fields and save a risk.
* They should be informed that either the save was successful or a validation error occured.
* All fields are mandatory.
* When changing the risk status to approved, the approval date should be set to today's date.
* The approval date should not be in the past.

Be prepared to discuss your solution and explain how you approached devising a test plan.
